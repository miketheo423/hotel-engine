## Closing Thoughts

- This project was a lot of fun to build! I think it's great that Github exposes a really easy to work with API that has some solid docs.

- I normally don't reach for component frameworks, but I've been meaning to give Semantic UI a try, so this seemed like a good opportunity to put it to use. I think it's a pretty robust library, but I prefer to write all my own components and styles to be honest. It seems like adding a framework generally adds a lot of unnecessary bloat, especially if you're only using a few components from it.
